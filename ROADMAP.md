# Roadmap
Here’s an overview of what the digestbot team is looking to work on over the next month.  

This is a living doc that will evolve as priorities grow and shift. Please feel free to file issues on this repository if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

## What we are working on:
* Ignore-list: we are planning to add ignore list to exclude different bimorphs
from results ^^
* ODS.ai QnA integration: add fastpath for search (from last user message)
* Tests: more and more and more and more (at least anything ><)
