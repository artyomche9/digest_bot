# Roadmap
Hereâ€™s an overview of what the digestbot team is looking to work on over the next month.  

This is a living doc that will evolve as priorities grow and shift. Please feel free to file issues on this repository if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

## What we are working on..
* **Your own presets:** we would like to give you a possibilty to create your own presets (visible only for you)
and use them for top message selecting.

* **Scheduled digest:** create a timer for any top command and receive fresh digest just-in-time! :)
