# Roadmap
Hereâ€™s an overview of what the digestbot team is looking to work on over the next month.  

This is a living doc that will evolve as priorities grow and shift. Please feel free to file issues on this repository if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.

## What we are working on:
* **Internal refactoring:** right now we are planning a global internal refactoring to divide UI from internal logic and simplify adding other UIs (like telegram bots, etc)

* **Issues solving:** see "Issues" for more information
